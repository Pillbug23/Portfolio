# Portfolio

Iâ€™m a UC Berkeley graduate with a strong interest in frontend. I enjoy problem-solving and coding. I have worked on technologies like Python, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Java during my bachelor's. I got into front end development because it was a form of programming that let me visualize my progress and results in a quicker and more literal way than other types of programming. React has been a personal favorite framework of mine for developing projects. I am passionate about developing applications centered around data visualization and constantly looking towards improving my skills and learning new libraries/frameworks.
