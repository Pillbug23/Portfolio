About Me
I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University. After graduating with my first undergraduate degree, I realized that I wanted a more formal education in computer science to pursue roles and projects that interest me. My areas of interest include web development, frontend design, backend and database interactions, and web accessibility. Through my projects, I aim to solve real-world problems and continuously learn new technologies and methodologies.
