    "The graph is not a normal curve and it is skewed to the left. We can see most of the scores are bunched towards the higher scores. This has a long left tail. There are gaps from 90-100 where we see that values 99,97 and 95 are missing. This is probably because health inspection scores are primary judged by even grading of points at least for higher scores, hence why we see no values for odd labeled scores. We know that 90-100 is incremented by 1, so each bar represents scores 90-100 by 1. We also see that the highest counts of scores are awarded to 100, where its count outnumbers most of the scores below 90, suggesting that resturants follow sanitiation guidelines."

We expected that the points lie above the regression line because we anticipate that second scores are higher than first scores. We also expected that the values difference from first to second inspection increase because we want scores to be higher second time around, yet we see in the graph that this is not the case, some values are worse second inspection. This signals that resturants tend to not see much change in their first and second score."
