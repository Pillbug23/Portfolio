# Gitlet
A custom version-control system similiar to git. Functionality includes intialziation of a version control system, adding and committing files, removing files, log information, checking out files, branching, and merging.

# Methods
* git init (java gitlet.Main init)

Creates a new version-control system in the current directory. It starts with with an initial commit, a single branch which points to the initial commit named "master". A stage directory is intialized here; think of it as a shopping cart holds items and empties it after it is checked out, If a control system already exists, an error message will be printed.
